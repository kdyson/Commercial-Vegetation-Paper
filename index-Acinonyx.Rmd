# Abstract


Humans actions influence vegetation community composition and functional diversity, altering ecosystem service provision, habitat quantity, and habitat quality in social-ecological systems [@faeth2011; @byrne2007; @lehmann2014]. 


I quantified the tree and shrub communities and ground cover area on office developments in Redmond and Bellevue, Washington, USA. I gathered information on the outcomes of development, landscaping, and management actions and used public databases to quantify socio-economic variables. As I focused on examining outcomes to assess and guide policy, I did not address developer or landowner choice or motivation, only the results of their actions and management decisions. I used cluster analysis to identify tree and shrub community types, and multivariate ecology tools including PERMANOVA and NMDS to identify variables explaining tree and shrub community structure. 

I found that vegetation communities are highly variable across office developments, and that development and landscaping actions best explain this variability. Additionally, studies using a limited number of sites per land use are potentially drawing incorrect conclusions about vegetation and habitat potential [@mcintyre2000urban]. Unlike residential property, variation in vegetation communities on office developments are explained more by development and land management actions and are not driven by socio-economics. This suggests a need for land use policy to be informed by ecological findings, and that altering human action may impact habitat quality and quantity available for other organisms.


Heterogeneity of landscaping within land use.

Science impact:
Design research sampling to account for within-land use heterogeneity

Policy impact:
Understanding how human actions influence vegetation communities and resulting habitat quality and quantity available to other trophic levels in the urban matrix facilitates decisionmaking to support local species.

Results from discussion:

I found that woody vegetation communities on office developments in Redmond and Bellevue, Washington are heterogenous with multiple groups identified by cluster analysis (Table \@ref(tab:CH2-site-summary-tables-tree)). This within land use heterogeneity has implications for how urban ecologists sample. Additionally, I found that the socio-economic variables which explain variation in woody vegetation communities on office developments include XYZ. These differ from other land uses, which found ABC (citations). This suggests that development and landscaping actions may impact the quality and quantity of habitat provided by woody vegetation on office developments, with important implications for public policy and urban conservation. 


Results from conclusion:
Human actions during development and landscaping meaningfully influence patterns of urban vegetation community composition. I observed distinct native and ornamental planting typologies within office developments resulting from tree preservation choices made during development and plant choice when landscaping [@faeth2011]. Tree community composition was associated with and shrub community composition was significantly explained by development and landscaping actions resulting in older, larger native conifers being present on site. Socio-economic variables found significant on other land uses were not important explanatory variables for vegetation communities on office developments. My results show that there is variability in vegetation communities both within office developments and between office developments and other land uses. 


# Introduction

Human actions when developing and landscaping urban land influence patterns of vegetation community composition, abundance, and distribution through disturbance and succession mechanisms [@lehmann2014; @faeth2011; @avolio2018; @pickett2008]. These patterns of the vegetation community alter ecosystem service provision and habitat quality and quantity in social-ecological systems [@faeth2011; @byrne2007; @lehmann2014]. 

In the Puget Sound region, development has replaced fire as the primary disturbance driver and precursor to new forest stands [@gibb2002; @walcott1899; @sharpe1986; @halpern1995]. The mechanisms of disturbance when clearing and grading land for development include removing trees and other vegetation, removing topsoil, and compacting soil with heavy equipment [@andres2004; @dorney1984; @mckinney2002; @grimm2017; @turner2005; Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-development-pic)]. Vegetation patterns impacted include species composition, abundance, and distribution, patch structure, legacy vegetation, vegetation structure, plant establishment, and seed banks [@alberti2005; @pickett2001; @gibb2002; @mullaney2015; @peters2011; @sharpe1986; @byrne2007; @faeth2011]. Decisions made by developers and land owners at the time of development determine the extent of disturbance and influence future site conditions. For example, choosing to preserve existing trees determines legacy vegetation and influences important stand characteristics like tree age [@dorney1984]. 

```{r FIG-development-pic, fig.cap='Commercial development project located in Redmond, WA illustrating: a. clearing the site of vegetation and b. grading the site and digging foundation.', out.width="80%", include=TRUE}

	knitr::include_graphics("../images/RedmondDevelopment.jpg")


```

Multiple processes determine the path of vegetation succession following disturbance. In social-ecological systems, both ecological succession processes like dispersal and regeneration from seed banks and socially mediated vegetation management influence vegetation succession [@zipperer2010process]. However, the latter has become the dominant plant establishment process contributing to succession [@grimm2017; @faeth2011; @widrlechner1990; @dorney1984; @vanheezik2014; @goodness2018]. Species composition, abundance, and distribution, and patch structure are among the vegetation patterns impacted by land owner decisions [@faeth2011]. The plants chosen are generally ornamental introduced shrubs, trees, or grasses, though using native species in landscaping is becoming more common [@vanheezik2014; @faeth2011; @germaine1998; @burghardt2009; @blair1996; @mckinney2002]. Once planted, these require significant energy and material inputs to arrest succession and maintain the desired aesthetic [@zipperer2010process; @faeth2011; @lebauer2008; @lepczyk2004]. Along with trees retained through tree preservation policies, these landscape plantings represent a significant portion of the vegetation on site and of the habitat quality and quantity available to other organisms [@faeth2011; @avolio2018].

Social factors motivating developer and land owner decisions in social-ecological systems are diverse. On office developments, development and landscaping choices are informed by a complex mix of trends in landscape design, office development marketing, regulations, landscape budget, expert opinion, and plant availability [@avolio2018; @widrlechner1990; @conway2016; @dorney1984]. On residential properties, neighborhood socio-economic variables including neighborhood age and wealth may explain much of the variation in planting choices [@hope2003; @clarke2013; @leong2018; @avolio2018]. Developers for all land uses are often motivated by cost and investment decisions [@almagor2017]; mass construction paired with removing existing vegetation is purportedly cheaper, though preserving vegetation may be less expensive in the long run [@mckinney2002].

In addition to social motivations, public policy both restricts and incentivizes developer and land owner actions when developing and landscaping urban land. Woody vegetation is responsible for aesthetic components of the landscape important to community identity and key ecosystem services like shade provision, rainwater interception, carbon sequestration, and primary productivity [@wolf2005; @collins2011; @elmendorf2008; @goodness2018; @conway2016]. As a result, many municipalities in the Puget Sound region and beyond have adopted clearing and grading permitting processes, impervious surface maximums and minimums via parking space requirements, tree protection policies, canopy cover goals, and vegetation planting policies [@young2011; @EPA2011; @delaria2008]. These have historically been important for determining urban vegetation in North America [@dorney1984]. For example, tree preservation policies dictate decisions that impact legacy vegetation, the abundance of old trees, and provision of native tree habitat. 

Together this combination of remnant, spontaneous, and planted natives and introduced species create vegetation communities and patterns in cities broadly and on office developments specifically [@wittig2010; @mckinney2002; @dorney1984]. As local biological communities are largely determined by available vegetation, landowner choices in planting vegetation impact food webs and biodiversity [@faeth2011; @avolio2018; @faeth2005]. For example, some common horticulturally-modified ornamental species like _Prunus_ are used less by native bees than related plants [@mach2018]. Introduced ornamentals are also unlikely to support the same insect species, or the same biomass or diversity of fauna as native habitat [@burghardt2009; @mckinney2002; @crisp1998; @rebele1994]. If insect populations and biomass change due to cultivated ornamental vegetation, species at higher trophic levels will also be impacted [@burghardt2009; @marzluff2001; @faeth2011]. 

While vegetation communities in the urban matrix can contribute to local biodiversity conservation, different decisions when developing and landscaping urban parcels will result in different quantity and quality of habitat available to other organisms [@alberti2003; @alberti2005; @polasky2005; @rosenzweig2003]. For conservation efforts to be successful, the matrix in which preserves are situated, including the built environment, must provide sufficient resources for local species [@miller2002; @fahrig2001; @fischer2006; @polasky2005; @rosenzweig2003]. This will require working with private landowners to alter private actions to support conservation of locally important vegetated habitat [@goddard2010; @miller2002]. 

Understanding the types of vegetation that result and the actions that create them is important for urban plant ecology and conservation. While vegetation surveys in urban areas have classified vegetation communities and examined human actions on residential neighborhoods and public open space [@dana2002; @hope2003; @lehmann2014], this research has generally not been extended to other land use types including office developments and other commercial land uses [@snep2011; @bourne2013]. This oversight means that there are important land uses in cities for which we lack information about the composition of vegetation communities.

To address this gap, I examine the link between socio-economic patterns, human actions, and observed patterns of vegetation on office developments. I ask:

1. What tree and shrub communities are present on office developments as a result of development and landscaping actions?
2. Are these communities correlated with different maintenance regimes or ground cover categories?
3. What variables describing socio-economic conditions or variables describing the outcome of development and landscaping actions explain variation in tree and shrub community structure?

> revise this in light of fungal revisions.


I hypothesize that vegetation communities on office developments are heterogeneous, and that different vegetation communities are correlated with different maintenance regimes and ground cover categories. I also hypothesize that neighborhood scale socio-economic variables found significant in explaining vegetation patterns on residential property will not be significant on office developments [commercial property; @avolio2018; @hope2003; @conway2016], but that site-scale socio-economic variables will be significant in explaining vegetation patterns. Finally, I hypothesize that development and landscaping actions explain variation in tree and shrub community structure.

I quantified tree and shrub communities on office developments in Redmond and Bellevue, Washington, USA. I found that vegetation communities are highly variable across office developments, and that development and landscaping actions best explain this variability. Unlike residential property, variation in vegetation communities on office developments are explained more by development and land management actions and are not driven by neighborhood or site scale socio-economic variables. The observed variability in woody vegetation suggests differences in habitat quality and quantity available to other organisms within one land use and has significant implications for how urban ecologists should approach sampling site design. Studies using a limited number of sites per land use are potentially drawing incorrect conclusions about vegetation and habitat potential based on the distribution of vegetation communities on each land use [@mcintyre2000urban].


# Materials and Methods {#CH2-methods}

## Study area and site selection

Redmond (2017 population 64,000) and Bellevue (population 144,000) are located east of Seattle in King County, Washington [@Census2017]. Both cities share a similar ecological history, a similar disturbance timeline for logging and agriculture, and have grown considerably since the opening of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (SR 520) in 1963. They are at similar elevations (< 500 ft) and experience the same climate and weather. The sampling frame was limited to Redmond and Bellevue north of I-90 and excluded developments in Bellevue’s central business district.

I used disproportionate stratified random sampling to ensure that my sample included sites across the entire vegetation gradient. >>XXXX<< office development parcels met the initial study criteria of office use as defined by the King County Assessor's Office. I grouped adjacent parcels with the same owner and similar age built (within 3 years) to create a unit of analysis based on human action not cadastral boundaries. The initial population size was `r length(population.covariates$vegetation_class) ` potential study sites.

I then classified the vegetation at each potential study site into type categories using a brief visual estimation during site visits in early 2014 (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-vegetation-types), Table \@ref(tab:TAB-veg-class-sum)). Sites with no vegetation, with wetlands, or those that were currently under construction or undergoing landscape replanting were excluded from the analysis (`r sum(population.covariates$vegetation_class %in% c("WW", "XX", "LP")) ` sites). The remaining pool of `r sum(!(population.covariates$vegetation_class %in% c("WW", "XX", "LP")))` potential sites had no notable hydrological features on site.

(ref:vegetationtypes) Examples of each vegetation type, from top left to bottom right: High (HH); Medium Canopy (MC); Medium Diverse (MD); Medium (MM); Low (LL); no vegetation (LP; excluded); wetlands (WW; excluded).

I conducted stratified random sampling on sites with HH, MC, MD, MM, and LL vegetation. I restricted the sampling pool to sites in the 25^th^ to 85^th^ percentile of site area and the 15^th^ to 85^th^ percentile of surrounding impervious surfaces. These limits were imposed to avoid confounding factors based on the smallest strata (HH). 

I requested property access through three mailings sent to the property owner or manager on file in the King County Assessor's database [@dyson2018]. I targeted vegetation categories underrepresented in my sample in the second and third mailings. Of 46 mailed requests, 20 (`r round(20/46 * 100, 1)`%) received no response or were not deliverable. Of the 26 (`r round(26/46 * 100, 1)`%) responses received, 6 (`r round(6/26*100, 1)`%) of were rejected and 20 (`r round(20/26*100, 1)`%) were accepted (Table \@ref(tab:veg-class-summary), Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-study-area-map)).

Commercial use of the sites in the sample included light industrial, white collar office space, and medical/dental offices. Some sites were fully leased to tenants, while others were either partly or fully owner-occupied. Company size ranged from less than 10 to many thousand employees.

## Independent variables

> these paragraphs are redundant and redundant w/ table info

Independent variables used in this analysis are defined in Table \@ref(tab:TAB-covariate-definitions). Previous research identified neighborhood socio-economic variables (median income, demographics) as significant [@hope2003; @martin2004; @walker2009; @dana2002; @grove2014; @QGIS]; these are included for comparison and to test whether surrounding residential property impacts residential developments. Commercial property variables include building quality and assessed land value. Unfortunately other measures were incorrect or incomplete. For example, some buildings received tax breaks following the 2008 recession resulting in an appraised value of 1,000 USD when the building's market value was greater than 5,000,000 USD.

I measured the height of dominant native conifers with a Nikon Forestry Pro Laser Rangefinder; this proxy measure was used as tree cores were not collected due to liability concerns [@dyson2018]. I used historical records and site construction plans to determine whether each site had a stand of 3 adjacent tree predating site development. I used _Pseudotsuga menziesii_ (Mirb.) Franco, _Thuja plicata_ Donn ex D. Don, and _Tsuga heterophylla_ (Raf.) Sarg. counts to calculate native conifer density. 

Broad ground cover material types were recorded on paper maps, then hand digitized in QGIS to calculate area [@QGIS]. Pervious cover types recorded include dense vegetation, dirt/litter, lawn (turf grass including moss and forb species), gravel, dense ivy, mulch, and water. I used semi-structured interviews of property owners, managers, and landscaping services along with site visits to obtain maintenance regime variables [@dexter1970; @harvey2011].

Sampled sites ranged from `r round(min(sample.covariates$DissolvedArea) * .00002296, 3)` acres to `r round(max(sample.covariates$DissolvedArea) * .00002296, 3)` acres in size. `r length(which(sample.covariates$DistrictName == "BELLEVUE")) ` sites were located in Bellevue and `r length(which(sample.covariates$DistrictName == "REDMOND"))` sites were located in Redmond. The office developments on study sites were built between 1975 and 2008.

(ref:distribution) Summary statistics for independent variables for both the population of office developments in Redmond and Bellevue and the sample of sites studied (`r sum(population.covariates$vegetation_class %in% c("WW", "XX", "LP")) ` and 20 sites, respectively). Sites were selected based on area and percent impervious. Median income ($) and % foreign born are included to compare patterns in commercial developments with patterns found significant in residential research.

## Vegetation data collection

I censused vegetation communities in summer of 2015. Each tree and shrub was identified to species or genus [@sibley2009; @dirr1997hardy; @dirr2009manual]. Trees with DBH < 4" were considered saplings and not included in analysis. This cutoff includes all "significant" trees in Redmond and Bellevue's zoning codes (greater than 6" or 8" DBH). Following @daniels2006yds, I grouped conifers under 2 m into a broad class of dwarf conifer species. `r sum(matrify.tree.sp.only[ , colnames(matrify.tree.sp.only) %in% c("cedar.1", "cedar.2", "unknown.broadleaf.1", "unknown.broadleaf.2", "unknown.broadleaf.3", "unknown.broadleaf.4", "unknown.broadleaf.5", "unknown.broadleaf.6")]) ` individual trees (`r 100*(sum(matrify.tree.sp.only[ , colnames(matrify.tree.sp.only) %in% c("cedar.1", "cedar.2", "unknown.broadleaf.1", "unknown.broadleaf.2", "unknown.broadleaf.3", "unknown.broadleaf.4", "unknown.broadleaf.5", "unknown.broadleaf.6")])/sum(matrify.tree.sp.only)) `%) and `r sum(matrify.shrub.site[ , 71:79]) ` shrubs (`r 100*(sum(matrify.shrub.site[ , 71:79])/sum(matrify.shrub.site) ) `%) could not be identified ; these were given a unique identifier code for multivariate community analysis. Some tree and shrub species were grouped at the genus level due to the abundance of very similar cultivars in the landscaping trade, including _Prunus_ L. sp. and _Malus_ Mill. sp.

I assigned tree and shrub genera to one of three provenance categories---native, non-native, or ambiguous [@USGSplants; @USDAplants]. The ambiguous category was used for genera including both native and non-native cultivated species that are difficult to distinguish, and/or frequently interbred and sold as crosses. For example, some _Mahonia_ Nutt. sp. are native (_M. aquifolium_ (Pursh) Nutt. and _M. nervosa_ (Pursh) Nutt.), while others originate in Asia (_Mahonia japonica_ (Thumb.) DC.) and many hybrids are bred and sold by nurseries (e.g. _Mahonia x media_ "Charity" Brickell).

In total, I observed `r sum(matrify.tree.sp.only)` individual trees and  `r sum(matrify.shrub.site)` individual shrubs (Supplemental Table A). The 20 office developments I sampled varied in tree and shrub abundance, density, and effective species richness (Table \@ref(tab:TAB-site-summary-tables-tree)).

## Data Analysis

Woody vegetation analysis methods are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-diagram-methods). I standardized tree and shrub abundance data and ground cover area by total site area in acres. This transformation preserves parcel boundaries as the unit of analysis and reflects developer and landowner actions during and following development that determine the amount of impervious surface and plantible area, the number of trees preserved, and the number of trees and shrubs planted. Between site standardization (e.g. Wisconsin standardization) was not used as the vegetation on all sites was completely censused.

### Identifying and describing vegetation clusters on office developments

I used flexible beta clustering and indicator species analysis to delineate vegetation community clusters on office developments. I used the agnes {vegan} function with beta = -0.5 to produce an ecologically interpretable dendrogram with minimal chaining [@mccune2002; @dufrene1997; @milligan1989; @breckenridge2000; @vegan]. 
I performed indicator species analysis, which assesses the predictive values of species as indicators of the conditions at site groups, using multipatt {indicspecies} [@decaceres2010; @indicspecies; @decaceres2013]. I ran the permutation-based function 100 times and took the mean of the indicator statistics generated for each species [@dysoncode].

After identifying vegetation community typologies, I used simple univariate PERMANOVA models to test if ground cover (%) differed between groups and Pearson's Chi-squared test to test if maintenance regime differed [adonis2 {vegan} and chisq.test {stats}; @vegan]. PERMANOVA is a permutation based implementation of ANOVA/MANOVA that avoids assumptions about underlying distributions of community structure and can be used with non-Euclidian distance matrices [@anderson2001]. Bartlett tests of homogeneity find no difference between group variances (bartlett.test {stats}).

### Explaining variation in tree and shrub community structure

I used a multi-step approach to avoid transforming independent variables or using ordination to collapse related variables, as these actions make results less interpretable for urban planners and other professionals without back transformation. I first tested each variable individually in a simple multivariate PERMANOVA model. I used ANOVA to test for significant differences in dispersion for categorical variables [anova {stats} and betadisper {vegan}; @vegan]. I then constructed models using all variables with significant pseudo-_F_ values ($\alpha \leq$ 0.05) in all possible single and multiple variable model combinations. I used a custom AICc function based on residual sums of squares to compare models and identify those with the best support [@dysoncode].

Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is a rank-based ordination technique that is robust to data without identifiable distributions, can be used with any distance or dissimilarity measure  [@mccune2002]. I used 100 repetitions of the metaMDS {vegan} implementation of NMDS to find a stable minima [@vegan; @mccune2002]. 


# Results and Discussion {#CH2-results}

I found that woody vegetation communities on office developments in Redmond and Bellevue, Washington are heterogenous with multiple groups identified by cluster analysis (Table \@ref(tab:TAB-site-summary-tables-tree)). This within land use heterogeneity has implications for how urban ecologists sample. Additionally, I found that the socio-economic variables which explain variation in woody vegetation communities on office developments include XYZ. These differ from other land uses, which found ABC (citations). This suggests that development and landscaping actions may impact the quality and quantity of habitat provided by woody vegetation on office developments, with important implications for public policy and urban conservation.

## Woody vegetation groups observed on office developments

I identified two groups of each tree and shrub vegetation based on flexible beta cluster analysis (flexible beta = -0.5; agglomerative coefficients of `r beta.5.tree$ac ` and `r beta.5.shrub$ac ` respectively; Table \@ref(tab:TAB-groupabund)). Using indictor species analysis, I found the Native Tree group (11 sites) is characterized by _Thuja plicata_, _Acer macrophyllum_ Pursh, _Arbutus menziesii_ Pursh, and _Alnus rubra_ Bong, while the Ornamental Tree group (9 sites) is characterized by _Acer rubrum_ L. The Native Shrub group (11 sites) is characterized by _Acer circinatum_ Pursh, _Corylus sp._ L., _Gaultheria shallon_ Pursh, _Mahonia sp._ Nutt., _Symphoricarpos sp._ Duham., and _Vaccinium parvifolium_ Sm., and the Ornamental Shrub group (9 sites) by _Prunus laurocerasus_ L.

                            ), .funs = mean)


```

In addition to the origin of tree and shrub species, the two groups are distinct in the average abundance of trees and shrubs per site (Native Tree mean = `r tree.ml.mean[1,'tot.abund'] `,
Ornamental Tree mean = `r tree.ml.mean[2,"tot.abund"] `
with Pr(>_F_) = `r count.tree[1,5] `; 
Native Shrub mean = `r shrub.ml.mean[2,"tot.abund"] `,
Ornamental Shrub mean = `r shrub.ml.mean[1,"tot.abund"] `
with Pr(>_F_) = `r count.shrub[1,5] `
). 
The median height of dominant native conifers was also significantly different between Native and Ornamental clusters for trees and shrubs (tree mean values = `r tree.ml.mean[1,"height.m.median"] ` m
and `r tree.ml.mean[2,"height.m.median"] ` m
with Pr(>_F_) = `r mheight.tree[1,5] `;
shrub mean value = `r shrub.ml.mean[2,"height.m.median"] ` m
and `r shrub.ml.mean[1,"height.m.median"]` m
with Pr(>_F_) = `r mheight.shrub[1,5]`).
However, there was no difference in area between Native and Ornamental clusters for either trees or shrubs (
tree Pr(>_F_) = `r area.tree[1,5]`;
shrub Pr(>_F_) = `r area.shrub[1,5]`). 

Other differences between the groups are also of interest. Associated ground cover on Native and Ornamental Tree sites differed significantly for percent impervious surface cover on site but not grass or combined dirt and liter cover. Native and Ornamental Shrub sites only differed for percent grass cover. Dead wood was significantly more abundant on Native Tree sites than Ornamental Tree sites 
(mean value = `r tree.ml.mean[1,"dead.wood"]`
and `r tree.ml.mean[2,"dead.wood"]`
with Pr(>_F_) = `r dw.tree[1,5]`),
but not between shrub site groups. Irrigation, mulching, herbicide, and fertilizer application had only three "no" responses and thus I cannot draw any well supported conclusions.

Finally, there was substantial co-occurance between Native and Ornamental groups. Of the 20 office developments surveyed, nine sites belong to both native tree and shrub community groups, and seven sites belong to both ornamental tree and shrub community groups.

## Implications for sampling design

The heterogenity I observed within a single land use has important implications for sampling design in urban ecology. In the population of 405 office developments studied here, the Native Tree and Shrub communities are more rare than Ornamental Tree and Shrub communities. More precisely, extrapolation suggests there are approximately 70 Native Tree and 335 Ornamental Tree developments for a ratio of around 1:5 developments, and 152 Native Shrub and 253 Ornamental Shrub developments for a ratio of around 2:5 developments (Table \@ref(tab:TAB-confusion-matrix)). Note the accuracy of these estimates will be influenced by the medium vegetation group (MM), as it is large and proportionally undersampled.

```{r TAB-confusion-matrix}


t1 <- tibble(`Tree Cluster` = c("Native", "Ornamental"),
          LL = c(1,4),
          MM = c(0,3),
          MD = c(2,2),
          MC = c(3,0),
          HH = c(5,0))
t2 <- tibble(`Shrub Cluster` = c("Native", "Ornamental"),
          LL = c(0,5),
          MM = c(1,2),
          MD = c(3,1),
          MC = c(2,1),
          HH = c(5,0))  

knitr::kable(list(t1, t2),
             caption = "Category overlap between visually estimated vegetation class and Native and Ornamental groups derived from flexible-beta clusteringfor trees and shrubs. LL = low vegetation; MM = medium vegetation; MD = medium w/diverse shrubs; MC = medium w/canopy cover; HH = high vegetation")

```

In this system, the choice of sampling design can result in very different conclusions when comparing different land uses or examining one land use across the urban gradient [e.g. @blair1999; @bourne2013]. For example, consider a small random sample of the entire population of 405 office developments in Bellevue and Redmond. This sample would contain all or almost all sites dominated by ornamental trees with a low chance of sampling the ecological communities found on sites dominated by native trees. 

If we consider the number of trees per site, the sample would not capture the fat right tail of sites with very high tree abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-extrapolated-dist)). If this sample is taken as representative of the whole population, it would lead to misleading conclusions about the range of vegetation communities on office developments alone or in comparison with other land uses [@mcintyre2000urban]. Thus, how researchers sample determines patterns found. Additionally, potential solutions already extant on the landscape may be overlooked.

Researchers should choose their sampling strategy carefully based on research questions and the underlying distribution of key variables. Though this statement is not new, it is worth reiterating for urban contexts with long vegetation and other environmental gradients [@mcintyre2000urban; @ellis1997; @telford2011]. If the phenomena of interest is related to vegetation cover/community composition, you must search out sites representing all vegetation types to measure the entire gradient. Collecting information, including visual estimation, of different types of vegetation communities on your land use prior to sampling can help improve your study's sampling design. For example, some studies have sampled based on native/non-native planting aesthetics based on knowledge of local landscaping patterns [e.g. @lerman2011].


## Socio-economic variables do not explain variation in tree and shrub community structure

### Neighborhood-scale socio-economics 

Neighborhood-scale socio-economic variables found important in residential land use research did not significantly explain variation in woody vegetation community composition on office developments [Table \@ref(tab:TAB-XXXXXXX); @hope2003; @martin2004; @luck2009; @schmid1975; @fraser2000; @clarke2013]. This confirms my hypothesis that neighborhood socio-economic variables specific to residential property are not necessarially important for commercial properties. 

When coupled with similar findings in municipal parks, these results suggest that different socio-economic drivers, motivations, and preferences drive vegetation community composition on each land use type [@kinzig2005; @martin2004; @leong2018; @faeth2011]. This mismatch means that urban ecologists cannot assume that the same variables or mechanisms explain variation for all land use types, and ecosystem models must reflect this.

For socio-economic variables to be significant drivers of vegetation on office developments, the surrounding socio-economic context would need to influence developer and landowner choices of trees and shrubs. This could occur in areas where office developments are adjacent and visible to residential property. However, zoning code in Bellevue and Redmond---as in much of the United States---actively separates and screens the different land uses from one another. 

Alternative explainations for woody vegetation communities on office developments include the intended audience and developer motivations. Unlike residential properties, where homeowners use vegetation choices to signal to their neighbors, owners of office developments are likely signalling to prospective and existing tenants [@nassauer2009; @laverne2003; @cook2012]. Studies examining why landscape architects make planting decisions are fewer in number than residential homeowners. In Toronto, factors like site aspect, appearance, and available space rate more highly in species selection than whether species are native and nearby canopy composition for landscape architects, however city staff try to plant native species whenever possible [@conway2016].

### Site-scale socio-economics

Site-scale socio-economic variables were also not significant in explaining variation in tree or shrub community composition on office developments. This includes site age, building quality (proxy for rent extraction), and assessed land value (land rent gradient). This is surprising and fails to support my hypothesis. 

Site age in particular was suggested as a determinant of woody vegetation community composition by studies on residential properties [@boone2010; @avolio2018], the professional knowledge of landscaping professionals I interviewed, and my examination of contemporaneous landscaping plans filed with the cities of Bellevue and Redmond. Landscaping professionals mentioned trends in plant popularity, including _Pieris japonica_ (Thunb.) D. Don ex G. Don in the late 1980s and increasing use of native plants since 2000. Alternative explainations for this finding include: building age is a poor measure for landscaping age due to replanting; an interaction between age and landscaping budget; or that only a subset of office developments are planted with in vogue landscape plants, such as the MM group which was undersampled.

Measures of site economic profitability are not well studied in urban ecology for commercial property. Urban ecologists need to collaborate with other fields, including real estate, to develop better coupled socio-economic and ecological models for the relationship between vegetation and land use. These may include what group currently manages an office development, whether it is tenant owned or leased, and for whom the property was originally developed. For these variables and site age, a larger sample size and inclusions of variables grounded in economic theory is needed.

## Development and landscaping actions 

The outcome of development and landscaping actions---including median dominant native conifer height (a proxy for stand age), native conifer density, and the presence of stands predating development---are associated with the first NMDS axis for the tree community and the Native Tree cluster (Figure \@ref(fig:FIG-tree-management-NMDS)). These outcome variables also significantly explained variability in shrub community structure using PERMANOVA. The best supported model included tree group membership and median Douglas-fir height, though other single variable PERMANOVA models and multiple two variable models received equal support (Table \@ref(tab:TAB-shrub-model-comparison)). These results supporty my hypothesis that the outcome of development and landscaping actions influence vegetation community composition.



Tree preservation appears particularly important. This matches clustering results and suggests that a suite of decisions is being made either to retain more trees and plant native shrubs or retain fewer trees and plant ornamental trees and shrubs. 

Actions taken by developers include ease of construction based on site conditions, cost, and development regulations.

## Study limitations 

> condense this

As with most urban ecology research, my relatively small sample size of 20 office developments creates power and other statistical barriers. However, limiting my sample size allowed me to collect a rich dataset including multiple taxonomic groups over and coordinate visits with property owners over 11-15 site visits. To include more sites, a larger team of scientists is required. 

The complex nature of social-ecological systems require sampling along multiple possibly correlated gradients, including socio-economic variation (e.g. development age) and ecological variation (as here, with vegetation communities). Many studies in urban ecology implicitly sample along the socio-economic gradient by sampling along the urban or density gradient. Stratifying along the vegetation gradient of office developments allowed me to uncover a number of important trends [@dysonbird2019; @dysonfungi2019]. Without this approach, I would not have been able to quantify the breadth of different vegetation typologies within one land use. However, using disproportionate stratified random sampling led to under sampling vegetation types in the "medium vegetation" category. Limiting my sampling design with respect to surrounding impervious surface and site area reduced my ability to detect the influence of these variables on vegetation community composition.

Further, my research design makes it difficult to compare with other studies. Other studies frequently use species richness and other index response variables with univariate regression instead of using multivariate regression [e.g. @hope2003; @martin2004]; these measures are often dependent on effort and other factors [e.g. compare @karlik2001; with @martin2004]. Vegetation research frequently uses a plot or transect design [@bourne2013]. I instead used a plotless design where the unit of analysis matched the management unit. This design allowed me to answer research questions concerning development, landscaping, and maintenance actions; transects confound different management regimes [@dyson2018].

# Conclusions and future research directions

Human actions during development and landscaping meaningfully influence patterns of urban vegetation community composition. I observed distinct native and ornamental planting typologies within office developments resulting from tree preservation choices made during development and plant choice when landscaping [@faeth2011]. Tree community composition was associated with and shrub community composition was significantly explained by development and landscaping actions resulting in older, larger native conifers being present on site. Socio-economic variables found significant on other land uses were not important explanatory variables for vegetation communities on office developments. My results show that there is variability in vegetation communities both within office developments and between office developments and other land uses. 

> condense this

While this research finds that the observable impacts of development and landscaping actions influence vegetation community composition, the human actions leading to what is currently observable are far more complex than represented here. For example, on one sampled property about a dozen large Douglas-fir were preserved during development, but were cut down by the landowner in the following 10-15 years. On other office developments, initial plantings of ornamental shrubs were replanted to be more ecologically conscious (native species, low water use). This research left developer's and landowner's motivations as a black box, and included a limited set of independent variables describing specific outcomes of their collective actions. Without a better understanding of developer and property owner motivations, our ability to interpret the vegetation community clusters is limited, as is our ability to make policy recommendations. 

Additional studies using joint socio-ecological research frameworks are needed to examine multiple factors driving decision-making, including development codes, previous land use, designer's aesthetic preferences, and explicit decisions made by the initial commercial site developers, possibly influenced by customer specifications, profit, costs, and previous experience or company aesthetic [@hakkinen2011; @nappi2006; @dorney1984; @conway2016]. These include interviews with developers, landscape architects, landowners, and others to better understand tree preservation and planting motivations [@hakkinen2011; @conway2016]; aesthetic preference studies as on residential developments [@larson2009; @harris2012]; tracing decision making pathways based on previous land use [@yang2017]; and expanding on this research to better capture various maintenance regimes.

There are also significant opportunities for research linking together human action, ecosystem processes, urban vegetation, and higher trophic levels [@dysonbird2019; @narango2017]. Research on urban plant communities is generally restricted to one specific land use---within parks, remnant forest patches, residential neighborhoods, and occasionally vacant properties and street trees---and it is unknown how far the results of these studies can be generalized to other land use types including office developments [@bourne2013]. Expanding this research to encompass the whole range of urban land use types, as well as investigating the mechanistic links between landscape patterns and processes at both site- and landscape-scales are areas for potential future research. The motivations and preferences driving human action on different land uses also need to be better understood.

>Studies are needed that use a paired plot design to examine the vegetation gradient in neighboring land uses with similar socio-economic contexts (e.g. adjacent industrial, residential, commercial) to compare how different land uses respond to the same socio-economic context. This should be coupled with research with components to address the what and why of different land user's motivations.
